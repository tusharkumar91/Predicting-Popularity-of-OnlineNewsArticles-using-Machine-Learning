# Predicting-Popularity-of-OnlineNewsArticles-using-Machine-Learning
Implementation of Machine Learning algorithms using Pytorch framework to predict the popularity of an online news article through its features. Uses the UCI dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+news+popularity)

Implementation includes the following:

* Implement ChiSquare and Fisher score method for understanding relevance of attributes to article popularity.
* Implement Logistic Regression and apply it on the dataset and also apply it on dataset only with relevant attributes
* Implement Decision trees and apply it on the dataset
* Implement Random Decision Forest and apply it on the dataset
* Implement Neural Network and apply it on the dataset.
* Convert URL to word embeddings using Glove and add them as features for Neural Network to see if content extracted from url adds benefit to predicting popularity.
* Implement Extra Trees Classifier and apply it on the dataset

A report in ACM format paper is also provided.
Please go through the ReadMe file in CSC440FinalProject-tusharku folder to understand how to execute the programs.
